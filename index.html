	<h1>THE WHEREABOUTS OF BIGFOOT</h1>
	<h2>Where is this Insolent Hairy Beast Hiding?! </h2>
	<p>Hello there. My name is Peter Mallow and I have been searching for BigFoot over 10+ years. It's hard and arduous work. Just when you think that you found him, you realize that it's just a macho squirrel terrorizing the forests of the PNW. PEOPLE, PLEASE STOP FEEDING THE SQUIRRELS! DUE TO OVERFEEDING, THEY'RE HULKING OUT AND ARE BEING MISTAKEN BY ME AS BIGFOOT. I'VE LOST MY REPUTATION AS A SCIENTIST BECAUSE OF THIS. PLEASE STOP FEEDING THE SQUIRRELS CHICKEN NUGGETS. JUST PLEASE STOP. Anywho, my search of 10+ years has come to an end. I have finally been able to track down BigFoot thanks to two girls, Nicole Carmen and Lucy Harding, who were out making a vlog when they found him. I mean, they nowhere have the crendentials I have, and let's just say, they found BigFoot by mistake. </p>
	<p>This being said, BIGFOOT IS REAL, PEOPLE! HE IS REAL! Enough with the conspiracy theories, there's actual proof that he exists as he is currently sitting in my living room sipping hot chocolate. As discovered, beasts need their hot chocolate fix-ins on cold, wintery days, too. </p>
